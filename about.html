  <p>So you came to know about me.
    Let me tell you about myself.

   I am a Gujarati and I don't know how to play garba.
   Pretty funny, right?
   I am studying BAF,
   the college I go to is Balbharti.
   I am in the last year of my under-graduation.
   I turned 20 this year.
   I have a friend call Vaibhav,
   and he doesn't no shit about anything, I mean literally anything.
   But, he think's he knows everything.
